# The role that Hero's play in SOS

Hero's perform two distinct roles in SOS: Explore (attacking the infected directly) and Military (increasing the battle stats of your troops)

## Explore
In this mode your Hero's wipe out Hordes of infected within an abandoned building. Depending on the difficulty of the Explore mission you may have to traverse multiple rooms and/or defeat a boss to finish the mission and collect your rewards.

## Military
In this mode the Hero's don't fight directly they increase the stats of your troops or decrease the stats of your opponent
