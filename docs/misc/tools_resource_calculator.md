# Resource Tools

## Resource Calculator v1

Fill in how many resources you need, how many resources you have (optional) and how quickly you can gather resources and the calculator will tell you how long it will take for you to gather that amount of resources. Your gathering speed can vary day by day dependant on the hero you choose for a particular rss type, research you have done, the talent tree you have selected, buffs you have activated, alliance benefits etc.

On the spreadsheet fill in only the white cells, grey cells contain pre-populated information or formulas. Populate the resource types you need to gather for and your gathering speeds (instructions below)
